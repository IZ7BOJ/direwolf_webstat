This file is a part of SIMPLE WEB STATICSTICS GENERATOR FROM Direwolf LOG FILE
It's very simple and small APRX statictics generator in PHP. It's parted to smaller files and they will work independent from each other (but you always need chgif.php).
This script may have a lot of bugs, problems and it's written in very non-efficient way without a lot of good programming rules. But it works for me.
